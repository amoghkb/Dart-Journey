Basic Concepts
Dart Syntax

Understanding basic syntax and structure of Dart programs.
Variables and Data Types

Declaring variables, types: int, double, String, bool, dynamic.
Constants

const, final, and late keywords, understanding immutability.
Operators

Arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators.
Control Flow

if, else, switch, ternary operator, and conditional expressions.
Functions

Defining functions, return types, parameters (positional, named), function expressions, and arrow functions.
Loops

for, while, do-while loops, and forEach for collections.
Lists

Creating and manipulating lists (adding, removing, iterating).
Sets

Defining and manipulating sets (adding, removing, iterating).
Maps

Key-value pairs, iterating, adding/removing items from maps.
Exception Handling

try, catch, throw, custom exceptions.
Null Safety

nullable types, null-aware operators (?., ??, !).
Intermediate Concepts
Classes and Objects

Defining classes, creating objects, constructors, instance variables, methods.
Getters and Setters

Defining getters and setters to access private fields.
Inheritance

Subclasses, super keyword, method overriding.
Polymorphism

Method overriding, dynamic dispatch, and runtime polymorphism.
Static Members

Static variables and methods in classes.
Named Constructors

Using named constructors to create objects in different ways.
Optional Parameters

Positional and named parameters, default values for parameters.
Function Types

Declaring function signatures and passing functions as parameters.
Async Programming

Future, async/await, handling asynchronous operations.
Streams

Creating and listening to streams, stream transformations.
Mixins

Reusing code in multiple classes without inheritance.
Collections (Advanced)

Working with more complex collections (nested collections, iterables).
Dart Libraries

Using core libraries and importing third-party libraries.
Advanced Concepts
Abstract Classes

Defining abstract classes and their use in object-oriented design.
Interfaces

Implementing interfaces in Dart.
Extension Methods

Extending functionality of existing classes and types.
Generics

Using generics to create reusable classes and methods.
Error Handling (Advanced)

Custom error classes, advanced exception handling patterns.
Concurrency

Isolates and parallel programming, understanding asynchronous concurrency.
Reflection

Using the dart:mirrors library (note: less commonly used in Flutter due to performance issues).
Packages and Libraries

Creating and publishing custom Dart packages, managing dependencies.
Unit Testing

Writing and running tests in Dart using the test package.
Memory Management

Understanding Dart's garbage collection and heap/stack management.
Dart VM & Compilation

How Dart code is compiled and executed in different environments (JIT vs AOT compilation).
